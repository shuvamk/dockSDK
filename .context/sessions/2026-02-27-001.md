## Summary
Enhanced DockSDK from v1.1.0 to v1.2.0 with Raycast-style Spotlight integration types. Added DockSpotlightProvider protocol for dynamic search, enhanced DockSpotlightAction with new properties, and added DockSpotlightResult for dynamic results.

## What Was Done
- **DockSpotlightAction.swift**: Complete rewrite — enhanced DockSpotlightAction with shortcutHint, priority, hasDrillDown, inlineResult, iconAccentColor. Added DockSpotlightResult class for dynamic search results with action closures. Added DockSpotlightCategory constants class.
- **DockSpotlightProvider.swift**: New file — DockSpotlightProvider protocol for real-time search, sub-views, lifecycle hooks. DockSpotlightProviderInfo metadata class.
- **DockPlugin.swift**: Added createSpotlightSubView(for:) optional method. Updated documentation for v1.2.0 Spotlight integration.
- **SDKVersion.swift**: Bumped from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0.

## Decisions Made
- DockSpotlightProvider is a separate @objc protocol, not merged into DockPlugin, for opt-in complexity
- DockSpotlightResult uses non-@objc action closure (same pattern as DockKeyBinding)

## Issues Discovered
- Cannot build-verify in sandbox (no Swift compiler on Linux VM). Needs Xcode compilation.

## Deferred / Incomplete Work
- Build verification with `swift build`
- Unit tests for new types
- Push to remote Git hosting

## Files Changed
- `Sources/DockSDK/DockSpotlightAction.swift` — Complete rewrite with DockSpotlightResult, DockSpotlightCategory
- `Sources/DockSDK/DockSpotlightProvider.swift` — New file
- `Sources/DockSDK/DockPlugin.swift` — Added createSpotlightSubView, updated docs
- `Sources/DockSDK/SDKVersion.swift` — Version bump to 1.2.0
